**Introduction**

The phenomenon of drug resistance was initially documented in 1945, when a strain of bacteria demonstrated resistance to the bactericidal effects of penicillin (Aminov R., 2010[\[GD1\]](#_msocom_1) )) and this event has since prompted extensive research into drug resistance worldwide, particularly concerning various pathogens. The World Health Organization has recognized drug resistance as a significant global threat, primarily attributing its rise to the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents (World Health Organization, 2015[\[GD2\]](#_msocom_2) ).

Drug resistance in cancer may arise when cancer cells develop the ability to evade and endure chemotherapy and other pharmacological treatments. This phenomenon is evidenced by the occurrence of sepsis and the associated mortality rates linked to it (Amila et al., 2021[\[GD3\]](#_msocom_3) )

**Factors Contributing to Drug Resistance**

The global increase in drug resistance among cancer cells is a pressing concern, characterized by the emergence of new resistance mechanisms. A significant contributor to this phenomenon is the efflux-mediated resistance observed in both bacteria and cancer cells. These efflux pumps are primarily encoded on the chromosome, although they can also be found on plasmids and the over expression of the P - glycoprotein on the cell membrane of most cancer cells. A prominent group within the antimicrobial resistance landscape is the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily. The RND efflux systems function as proton/drug antiporters, facilitating the expulsion of a wide range of antibacterial agents, including numerous antibiotics and most chemotherapeutic drugs (Xian - Zhi et al., 2009[\[GD4\]](#_msocom_4) )(Xian - Zhi et al., 2004[\[GD5\]](#_msocom_5) ).

Hiroshi N., et al [\[GD6\]](#_msocom_6) discovered that the structure and mechanisms of the RND pumps AcrAB-TolC in Escherichia coli play a significant role in the efflux of a diverse array of antibacterial agents.

Bacteria and cancer cells alter their target sites to develop resistance to antibiotics.

Such alterations may result from spontaneous mutations in the genes of either cancer or bacteria located on the chromosome, as well as from selective pressure exerted by the presence of the antibiotic. These changes are often the result of mutations affecting RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. Additionally, target sites may be modified through the activation of downstream signaling pathways or compensatory mechanisms (Lambert P., 2005[\[GD7\]](#_msocom_7) )

(Zi-Ning et al., 2023[\[GD8\]](#_msocom_8) ).

A majority of chemotherapeutic agents induce DNA damage, including single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, and chemical alterations to the nitrogenous bases. If these damages remain unrepaired over time, they can result in genomic instability and mutations, ultimately leading to the demise of cancer cells (Li L et al., 2021[\[GD9\]](#_msocom_9) ).

The mechanisms of repair contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancer cells, as evidenced by the impairment of the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway, which plays a crucial role in the repair of double strand breaks. This defect has been linked to the formation of glioblastoma multiforme and has further enhanced the resistance of glioblastoma multiforme to treatment (Squatrito et al., 2010[\[GD10\]](#_msocom_10) ).

**Conclusion**

The issue of drug resistance in cancer therapy has persisted for many years, as cancer cells evolve through mutations to survive treatment. It is essential to enhance the effectiveness of existing therapeutic approaches and to identify new medications that can safeguard cancer patients from resistant pathogens and cells that exhibit resistance to treatment.
